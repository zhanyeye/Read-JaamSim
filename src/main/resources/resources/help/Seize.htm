<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The <span class=SimObjectChar>Seize</span>
object allocates one or more units of a specified set of <span
class=SimObjectChar>Resources</span> on receiving an incoming entity.</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>If any of the <span
class=SimObjectChar>Resources</span> have insufficient units available, the
received entity is directed to a <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span> object
identified by the <span class=KeywordChar>WaitQueue</span> keyword.  All
entities received by the <span class=SimObjectChar>Seize</span> object first
pass through this <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span> object, even if
sufficient units of the <span class=SimObjectChar>Resources</span> are
available.</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>Entities can be sent directly to
the <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span> specified by the <span
class=KeywordChar>WaitQueue</span> keyword.  Whenever an entity is added to the
<span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span>, all the Seize objects that specified
this <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span> as their <span class=KeywordChar>WaitQueue</span>
will be notified.  The first <span class=SimObjectChar>Seize</span> block that
has sufficient resource units available will then remove the entity for
processing.</p>

<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>Entities waiting for the same <span
class=SimObjectChar>Resources</span> at more than one <span
class=SimObjectChar>Seize</span> object are processed in order of the priority
assigned to them by the input to their <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue’s</span>
<span class=KeywordChar>Priority</span> keyword.  If the entities in two or
more <span class=SimObjectChar>Queues</span> have the same priority value, then
the one that has waited the longest is chosen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of the specified <span class=SimObjectChar>Resources for
the selected entity</span> must be available before any are seized.  Once all
of them are available, they are seized simultaneously.</p>
