<p class=Main style='page-break-after:avoid'>The <span class=SimObjectChar>EntityGate</span>
object allows incoming entities to be blocked temporarily.</p>

<p class=Main>When the <span class=SimObjectChar>EntityGate</span> is open and
the <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span> is empty, incoming entities pass
through without delay.  When it is <span class=StateChar>closed</span>,
incoming entities are directed to a <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span> where
they are held until the <span class=SimObjectChar>EntityGate</span> becomes <span
class=StateChar>Open</span>.  When the <span class=SimObjectChar>EntityGate</span>
opens, the queued entities are released one at time, separated by a delay
determined by the <span class=KeywordChar>ReleaseDelay</span> keyword.  This
delay does not apply to entities that arrive when the <span
class=SimObjectChar>EntityGate</span> is <span class=StateChar>open</span>. 
However, if queued entities are still being released, an incoming entity is
placed at the end of the <span class=SimObjectChar>Queue</span> even though the
<span class=SimObjectChar>EntityGate</span> is <span class=StateChar>Open</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <span class=SimObjectChar>EntityGate's</span> state,
either <span class=StateChar>Open</span> or <span class=StateChar>Closed</span>,
is determined by the input to the <span class=KeywordChar>OperatingThresholdList</span>
keyword, which specifies a list of threshold objects such as <span
class=SimObjectChar>SignalThreshold</span>, <span class=SimObjectChar>TimeSeriesThreshold</span>,
or <span class=SimObjectChar>ExpressionThreshold</span>.  All of the specified
threshold objects must be open for the <span class=SimObjectChar>EntityGate</span>
to become <span class=StateChar>Open</span>.</p>
